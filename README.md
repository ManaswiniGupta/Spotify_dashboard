# Spotify Dashboard

🚀🎶 Excited to share my latest project! 🎶🚀

I'm thrilled to announce that I've just completed creating a Spotify Music Analysis Dashboard using Power BI! 📊✨ This project has been an incredible journey, diving deep into the world of music data and transforming it into meaningful insights.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes the most streamed songs of 2023, providing a rich foundation for analysis. With the help of ChatGPT, I was able to seamlessly add a URL column to the dataset, enhancing the depth of information available. 🤖💡

Key Features of the Dashboard:
🔍 Popular Genres and Artists: Discover which genres and artists are dominating the charts in 2023. 📈

⏳ Track Performance Over Time: Visualize how individual tracks are trending, identifying peaks and patterns in their popularity. 📆

🎵 Detailed Playlist Analytics: Get insights into how different playlists are performing, and what tracks are making the biggest impact. 📋

Leveraging the power of data visualization, this dashboard turns raw data into actionable insights for music enthusiasts, industry professionals, and data geeks alike! Whether you're looking to understand the current trends, discover new music, or analyze the performance of your favorite tracks, this dashboard has something for everyone. 📊💡
